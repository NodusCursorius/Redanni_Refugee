# Redanni_Refugee
A modification of of [Litcube's Universe](http://litcube.xtimelines.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), which is an overhaul of [Egosoft's X3: Albion Prelude](http://www.egosoft.com/games/x3ap/info_en.php)

Start off with a heavily damaged Atmospheric Lifter, containing basic supplies, combat drones, and survivors. Your ship will already be under attack by three Xenon/OCV fighters. Survive the initial assault and the starting sector's wealth is yours.


## The tl;dr incomplete list of changes

Minor alterations to Litcube's map, apart from the starting sector and adding Terran Orbital Lasers/Terran Drones to various stations. Minor changes to the TDocks, essentially swapping out the Argon player headquarters with the Terran version. Starting sector location changed, as well as background graphic and music.


## Notes

Sector background and music are both from Homeworld. Excluding *_srccat\L\true\start52.jpg*, the rest of the code is given freely under MIT licensing.

Copy the **addon** and **soundtrack** folders into your base X3 directory. The **_srccat** directory contains the scripts and files used within the included *addon\10.cat*

Modified files are based off of: Litecube's Universe version **1.7** / X3 AP non-steam executable **3.0**
